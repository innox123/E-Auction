          MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords alone. Even if an
          attacker manages to obtain a user's password, they would still need
          access to the additional factor(s) to gain entry. This significantly
          reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

          Account takeover attacks, where unauthorized individuals gain access
          to user accounts, become more prevalent without MFA. ATO attacks can
          lead to data breaches, financial losses, identity theft, and
          reputational damage for individuals and organizations.
